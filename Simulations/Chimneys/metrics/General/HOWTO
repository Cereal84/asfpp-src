Start the simulation.

When the simulation ends make a directory, e.g. Example.

Move all the .txt files generated by the simulation into Example.
Copy all the files in Script directory and paste them into Example.

Use the bash script compute.sh by typing:

~/asfpp/Simulations/Chimneys/metrics/example$ ./compute.sh
	
compute.sh generates some _avg files. They are ready to use.

Use stacks.plt to obtain the graphic rendering of the attack: 

~/asfpp/Simulations/Chimneys/metrics/example$ gnuplot stacks.plt

Edit stacks.plt and Thresholds to change the graphical rendering.
